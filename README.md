# faceDetection_API

This is a web backend Restful API server using NodeJS with Express.js and PostgreSQL connector (pg) library and integrated with 3rd party APIs.
The API controlled user authentication, encrypted password using Bcrypt when storing user profiles into the database, and authorized users to upload an image and use the Clarifai API functions.

The interface of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/Joanne-PYL/faceDetection_interface).
